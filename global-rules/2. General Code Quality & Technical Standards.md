Language-specific rules override general rules.

### Readability & Maintainability

* Use descriptive names; avoid abbreviations.
* Add comprehensive comments (JSDoc, TSDoc, Python Docstrings).
* Apply DRY principles appropriately.

### Robustness & Security

* Follow language-specific standards and best practices.
* Always handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages.
* Always validate and sanitize external inputs.
